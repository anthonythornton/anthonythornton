## Product Manager, FinTech Enthusiast, Avid Traveler

At the age of 26, Anthony has worked for a number of startups across a wide range of industries, and has even launched one of his own. His passion for entrepreneurship has led him to opportunities in the fields of translation and localization, health care, mobile technology, his own venture in green transportation, and FinTech. This practical experience, combined with a rigorous academic background in business, makes him a promising young leader in the fields of entrepreneurship and product management. 

Anthony used his expertise in startup financing and brand management to conceive and launch the luxury skateboard brand Latitude Longboards. In 2014 Anthony assembled a team and successfully bootstrapped seed investment through the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo. He now regularly consults with the team and continues to monitor their already promising growth. 

As a Product Manager at Savedo he makes sure his team has what they need to deliver the right products at the right time. The company has quickly become the European retail investment marketplace, connecting consumers with financial institutions by using scalable technology and agile development methods.

Anthony is tenaciously optimistic, and prides himself on the ability to make you smile, even in the most stressful situations. You will see his best results when he is part of a dynamic team, and loves being thrown into new situations with new problems to solve.

Now at Coda Payments Anthony is building products that enable customers to more easily make payments online.
